# Credit-Wise-Loan-Approval-Prediction-System
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant financial information.

📌 Problem Statement
Financial institutions must assess loan applications carefully to minimize financial risk.
This project builds and compares multiple machine learning models to predict loan approval status using structured financial data.

🎯 Objective

🔹Compare different classification algorithms
🔹Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics
🔹Understand trade-offs between Precision, Recall, and Accuracy
🔹Analyze business impact in financial risk prediction

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains applicant financial and demographic details such as:
Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Employment Status and Other relevant features
Target Variable: Loan Status (Approved / Not Approved)

⚙️ Machine Learning Models Implemented
🔹Logistic Regression
🔹Naive Bayes
🔹KNN

📈 Key Insights
🔹Logistic Regression achieved the highest overall accuracy (87.5%).
🔹Naive Bayes achieved slightly higher precision (0.8036).
🔹In loan approval systems, precision is important because approving a risky applicant (False Positive) may lead to financial loss.
🔹Feature engineering does not always guarantee improvement — proper validation is essential.
🔹Model evaluation should align with business objectives, not just accuracy.

🧠 What I Learned
-How to compare classification models properly
-Importance of confusion matrix interpretation
-Trade-offs between Precision and Recall
-Practical implementation of financial risk prediction
-Impact of feature engineering on different algorithms
